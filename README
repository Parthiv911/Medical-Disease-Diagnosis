The Project inputs various medical parameters related to Polycystic Ovary Syndrome and uses a Logistic Regression Model to display the probability of the person having PCOS.

Around 30% of the Data Set was used to test the model. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The resultant accuracy was found to be 88%
The Confusion Matrix is as follows

Confusion matrix: 

               Predicted No     Predicted Yes
Actual No           105                8
Actual Yes          11                38

(No represents the situation where the person is predicted/found to NOT have PCOS)
(Yes represents the situation where the person is predicted/found to have PCOS)

The Source Code of the project is the python file "PCOSproject.py". 
The Data Set used to train the ML model is in available in the file "PCOS_data.csv".
